    "What do medical imaging, autonomous cars and satellite imagery have in common? In each of these fields, you need to be able to detect distinct objects with great precision. Perfect, you already know an arsenal of deep-learning techniques for object detection. However, here we need something more precise than simple coarse detection, namely to know contours with a high degree of accuracy, whether it's counting cells, not mistaking a pedestrian for a lamppost or detecting undeclared private swimming pools [[1]].\n",

    "They employ a common technique known as image segmentation, which is a computer vision method that automatically divides an image into regions of pixels associated with the same object class. Image segmentation manifests in two primary forms: semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves classifying image pixels as either belonging or not belonging to a specific category. Conversely, instance segmentation provides more detailed information by delineating distinct instances of the same object, such as identifying multiple cats in one image instead of a single 'blob' labeled 'cats'. If one desires to perform both types of segmentation simultaneously, as seen in autonomous driving applications where the road is identified as one 'blob' (semantic segmentation) and each pedestrian is individually outlined (instance segmentation), the combined use of both techniques is referred to as [panoptic segmentation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/panoptic-segmentation). This entails employing both methods concurrently on different parts of the image."
